1. Create a new project and name it "Parking Lot".
2. Import a floor plan of the parking lot in JPEG, PNG, PDF, TIFF or AutoCAD DWG format. You can use the "Import Floor Plan" button on the toolbar or the "File -> Import Floor Plan" menu option.
3. Scale the floor plan using the "Scale" button on the toolbar or the "Tools -> Scale" menu option. You can use a known dimension of the parking lot or a reference object to set the scale.
4. Add cameras to the floor plan using the "Add Camera" button on the toolbar or the "Tools -> Add Camera" menu option. You can drag and drop the cameras to adjust their positions and orientations.
5. Select a camera model from the database of 10,000+ camera models. You can use the "Camera Model" button on the toolbar or the "Tools -> Camera Model" menu option. You can also search for a specific camera model by name, brand, resolution, sensor size, lens type, etc.
6. Adjust the camera parameters such as lens focal length, sensor size, resolution, compression, frame rate, etc. using the "Camera Parameters" button on the toolbar or the "Tools -> Camera Parameters" menu option. You can also use the sliders on the right panel to change these parameters.
7. Check the pixel density (PPM/PPF) of each camera using the "Pixel Density" button on the toolbar or the "Tools -> Pixel Density" menu option. You can see the pixel density values for different zones of each camera on the floor plan and on the right panel. You can also see the minimum pixel density required for identification, recognition, observation and detection according to EN 62676-4: 2015 standard.
8. Make sure that each camera has enough pixel density to identify the license plates of the cars in its zone. You can use the "Zoom In" and "Zoom Out" buttons on the toolbar or the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the floor plan. You can also use the "3D View" button on the toolbar or the "View -> 3D View" menu option to see a realistic 3D simulation of each camera's view.
9. Estimate the network bandwidth and storage needs for your video surveillance system using the "Bandwidth and Storage Calculator" button on the toolbar or the "Tools -> Bandwidth and Storage Calculator" menu option. You can see the total bandwidth and storage requirements for all cameras in your project on the right panel. You can also change some paramete
