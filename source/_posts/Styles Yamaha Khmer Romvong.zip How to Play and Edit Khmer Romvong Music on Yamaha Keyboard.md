# How to Download and Install CST MICROWAVE STUDIO for Free
 
CST MICROWAVE STUDIO is a software tool for the 3D electromagnetic simulation of high frequency components, such as antennas, filters, couplers, planar and multi-layer structures, and signal integrity and electromagnetic compatibility effects. It is part of the CST STUDIO SUITE, which also includes other modules for low frequency, static and thermal analysis.

It also comes with tutorials and examples that cover typical textbook problems and applications.
 
To download the CST STUDIO SUITE Learning Edition, you need to register for a free 3DS Passport account on the 3DEXPERIENCE Edu website[^2^]. After logging in with your username and password, you can access the download link and the installation instructions. You will also need to request a license file by filling out a form with your personal and academic details. The license file will be sent to your email address within a few hours.
 
Once you have downloaded the software and received the license file, you can follow the installation guide[^2^] to install CST STUDIO SUITE on your Windows PC. You will need to copy the license file to a specific folder and activate it using the License Manager tool. After that, you can launch CST MICROWAVE STUDIO from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut and start creating and analyzing your own electromagnetic models.
 
If you need more help or guidance, you can visit the SIMULIA Community[^2^], where you can find more tutorials, learning resources, e-seminars, and forums to discuss simulation topics with other users and experts. You can also contact the CST support team if you encounter any technical issues or have any questions about the software.

In this article, we will show you how to create a simple dipole antenna model in CST MICROWAVE STUDIO and perform a frequency domain analysis to calculate its input impedance and radiation pattern. A dipole antenna is one of the simplest and most widely used types of antennas, consisting of two identical conductive rods connected to a feed point.

To create the dipole antenna model, follow these steps:
 
1. Open CST MICROWAVE STUDIO and create a new project. Choose the Frequency Domain solver and set the frequency range from 0.5 GHz to 1.5 GHz.
2. In the 3D Modeler window, select the Wire tool and draw two vertical wires of length 0.1 m each, separated by a gap of 0.01 m at the center. The wires should be aligned with the Z-axis and centered at the origin.
3. Select the wires and assign them a Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) material from the Material Library.
4. Select the gap between the wires and assign it a Discrete Port from the Boundary Library. This will define the feed point of the antenna.
5. In the Navigation Tree, expand the Background node and double-click on Open (add space). This will define the open boundary conditions for the simulation domain.
6. Click on the Mesh button and generate a tetrahedral mesh for the model. You can adjust the mesh settings to refine or coarsen the mesh as needed.
7. Click on the Run button and start the simulation. Wait for the simulation to finish and view the results in the Postprocessing window.

In the Postprocessing window, you can plot various quantities related to the antenna performance, such as S-parameters, input impedance, VSWR, current distribution, near and far fields, radiation pattern, directivity, gain, etc. You can also compare your results with theoretical or experimental data, or perform parametric studies to optimize your design.
 
As an example, we will plot the input impedance and radiation pattern of the dipole antenna at 1 GHz. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In the Navigation Tree, expand the 1D Results node and double-click on Zin (1). This will plot the input impedance of the antenna as a function of frequency.
2. Right-click on the plot and select Add Marker. Enter 1 GHz as the frequency value and click OK. This will add a marker at 1 GHz showing the input impedance at that frequency. You can see that it is about 73 ohms, which is close to the theoretical value of 73 + j42.5 ohms for an ideal dipole antenna.
3. In the Navigation Tree, expand the 3D Results node and double-click on Farfield (1). This will plot the far field radiation pattern of the antenna in 3D.
4. In the Plot Properties window, select Phi Cut from the Cut Type drop-down menu and enter 90 deg as the Phi value. This will show a 2D plot of the radiation pattern in the XY-plane.
5. Right-click on the plot and select Add Marker. Enter 1 GHz as the frequency value and click OK. This will add a marker at 1 GHz showing the radiation pattern at that frequency. You can see that it has a figure-of-eight shape with two lobes along the X-axis and nulls along the Y-axis, which is typical of a dipole antenna.

You have now successfully created and analyzed a dipole antenna model in CST MICROWAVE STUDIO. You can experiment with different parameters and settings to explore other aspects of electromagnetic simulation and antenna design.
