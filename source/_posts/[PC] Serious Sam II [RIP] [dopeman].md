Serious Sam II is not a game for the faint of heart or the easily frustrated. The game is very challenging and requires quick reflexes, accuracy, and strategy to survive. The game offers four difficulty levels, ranging from Tourist (easy) to Serious (hard). The game also features a lives system, where the player has a limited number of lives to complete each level. If the player runs out of lives, they have to restart the level from the beginning. The game also has a permadeath mode, where the player has only one life for the entire game.
